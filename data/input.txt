O thou  my lovely boy  who in thy power
Dost hold Time s fickle glass  his sickle  hour
Who hast by waning grown  and therein show st
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow st
If Nature  sovereign mistress over wrack
As thou goest onwards  still will pluck thee back
She keeps thee to this purpose  that her skill
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
Yet fear her  O thou minion of her pleasure
She may detain  but not still keep  her treasure
Her audit  though delay d  answer d must be
And her quietus is to render thee
My mistress  eyes are nothing like the sun
Coral is far more red than her lips  red
If snow be white  why then her breasts are dun
If hairs be wires  black wires grow on her head
I have seen roses damask d  red and white
But no such roses see I in her cheeks
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
I love to hear her speak  yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound
I grant I never saw a goddess go
My mistress  when she walks  treads on the ground
And yet  by heaven  I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare
When  in disgrace with fortune and men s eyes
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon myself and curse my fate
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Featured like him  like him with friends possess d
Desiring this man s art and that man s scope
With what I most enjoy contented least
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
Haply I think on thee  and then my state
Like to the lark at break of day arising
From sullen earth  sings hymns at heaven s gate
For thy sweet love remember d such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments  Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
It is the star to every wandering bark
Whose worth s unknown  although his height be taken
Love s not Time s fool  though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickle s compass come
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me proved
I never writ  nor no man ever loved
Shall I compare thee to a summer s day
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
And summer s lease hath all too short a date
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimm d
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or nature s changing course untrimm d
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
Nor shall Death brag thou wander st in his shade
When in eternal lines to time thou growest
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
